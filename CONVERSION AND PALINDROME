Expression conversion 
Procedure to convert Infix to Postfix
1. Scan the Infix string from left to right.
2. Initialize an empty stack.
3. If the scanned character is an operand, add it to the Postfix string.
4. If the scanned character is an operator and if the stack is empty push the character to stack.
5. If the scanned character is an Operator and the stack is not empty, compare the precedence of the character 
with the element on top of the stack.
6. If top Stack has higher precedence over the scanned character pop the stack else push the scanned character 
to stack. Repeat this step until the stack is not empty and top Stack has precedence over the character.
7. Repeat 4 and 5 steps till all the characters are scanned.
8. After all characters are scanned, we have to add any character that the stack may have to the Postfix string.
9. If stack is not empty add top Stack to Postfix string and Pop the stack.
10. Repeat this step as long as stack is not empty.


PROGRAM THAT CHECKS WHETHER STRING IS PALINDROME  OR NOT

Problem Solution 
1. Take a string as input.
2. Store the string in the stack array.
3. Check whether the string is palindrome or not.
Program Explanation
1. Take a string as input and store it in the array s[].
2. Load each character of the array s[] into the array stack[].
3. Use variables front and top to represent the last and top element of the array stack[].
4. Using for loop compare the top and last element of the array stack[]. If they are equal, then delete the top 
element, increment the variable front by 1 and compare again.
5. If they are not equal, then print the output as “It is not a palindrome”.
6. Compare the elements in the steps 4-5 upto the middle element of the array stack[].
7. If every characters of the array is equal, then it is a paliandrome
